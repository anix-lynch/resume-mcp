# How to Reserve a New Domain (Not Edit Existing)

## 🎯 The Issue

You're looking at your **free dev domain** (`proterandrous-tawanda-unborne.ngrok-free.dev`)
- This is free but has a random name
- You can only edit the description
- You can't change the domain name

## ✅ Solution: Reserve a NEW Domain

With your $10/month plan, you can **reserve a new domain** with your own name!

### Steps:

1. **Go back to Domains list:**
   - Click the "X" to close the domain details
   - You should see the list of domains

2. **Click "+ New Domain"** button

3. **Choose "Reserved Domain"** (NOT "Custom Domain")
   - Reserved Domain = ngrok static domain (works with $10 plan)
   - Custom Domain = your own domain (requires upgrade)

4. **Enter your chosen name:**
   - Example: `anix-resume`
   - Example: `resume-mcp`
   - Example: `gozeroshot-resume`
   - (Only letters, numbers, hyphens - no spaces)

5. **Click "Reserve"**

6. **Your new domain will be:**
   - `anix-resume.ngrok-free.app` (or whatever you chose)
   - This is your static domain that never changes!

## 💡 Important

- **Don't try to edit the dev domain** - you can't change its name
- **Reserve a NEW domain** with your $10/month plan
- You can have multiple domains, so keeping the dev domain is fine

## 🎯 Recommendation

Reserve: `anix-resume.ngrok-free.app`
- Short, memorable
- Professional
- Works with your plan!

Once you reserve it, tell me and I'll set everything up!
